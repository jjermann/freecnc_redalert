FreeCNC Requirements
====================
* A C++ compiler such as G++ >= 2.95 or MS Visual C++ >= 6
* SDL 1.2.x or greater.
* The "required" .mix files from Command & Conquer
  (See Configuration Section Below)

The following is optional:
* SDL_net 1.2.x or greater.
* zlib for the tgz plugin.

Compiling FreeCNC on a system with GNU tools
============================================
1) Untar the freecnc tarball and cd into the directory it decompresses.
2) Run "make".  This should automatically detect whether you have SDL_net and/or
zlib installed as well as whether any special flags need to be used when
compiling linking.
3) The compilation produces an executable called "freecnc", and two dynamic
objects, "mix.vfs" and "tgz.vfs" (or just mix.vfs if you don't have zlib
installed)

Please ensure that mix.vfs has been built and is in the same directory as the
FreeCNC binary as the program will most likely not run if it isn't there.

Compiling with Mingw
====================
The normal approach should work, but MSYS must be installed.  Also ensure that
sdl-config is working.

Compiling with MSVC
===================
NOTE: If you use MSVC 6, you must be using the latest service pack as our
code causes a few compiler bugs to manifest.
NOTE: The MSVC project isn't updated any more as none of the active developers
have MSVC, although contributions are welcome.
UPDATE (2003-11-15): Raymond Martineau has sent in a revised DSP file.

Compiling FreeCNC with something else
=====================================
If you have managed to successfully compile and run freecnc with something not
mentioned here, please let us know.  In theory, any platform that can support
SDL, SDL_net and dynamic linking should work.  If alternative CFLAGS or LDFLAGS
were needed, send in the appropriate files to drop into setup

Installing FreeCNC
==================
FreeCNC relies on several data files (.mix files) from the original Command &
Conquer. The .mix files can usually be extracted directly from the C&C CD or
from an correctly installed C&C Directory.

Tiberian Dawn
-------------
If you have the original (i.e. not Windows 95 or SVGA) version of C&C you need the following files:

    * conquer.mix
    * general.mix
    * desert.mix
    * temperat.mix
    * winter.mix
    * local.mix (located in the install subdirectory)
    * speech.mix (located in the aud1 subdirectory)
And it is recommended but not required that you have these files:
    * scores.mix
    * sounds.mix
    * movies.mix
    * transit.mix

If you have the Windows 95 (GOLD) or SVGA version of C&C then you need
the files mentioned above plus the following files, which are not
directly available from the CD.
    * cclocal.mix
    * updatec.mix
    * deseicnh.mix
    * tempicnh.mix
    * winticnh.mix
    * speech.mix

There have been several reports of the windows version installing
properly in Wine, although it would be nice if someone digs up an
extractor for the right version of installshield used.

If you have the Covert Operations CD then copy the following files to
access the new missions:
    * sc-000.mix
    * sc-001.mix

It has been reported that freecnc runs with just the Covert Ops CD,
although the number of maps available is limited.

At this time, the Macintosh edition is not supported, but the demo files
are available from Westwood's FTP server.

The ini files can either be left in the conf subdirectory of where the
freecnc binary resides, or be copied/moved to /etc/freecnc.

It is possible to have access to both sides by copying the mixfiles
onto your harddrive: only the general.mix and movies.mix files
differ.  Ensure that the four different files are named uniquely, e.g.
general-GDI.mix, and edit conf/files.ini appropriately.

Red Alert 1
-----------
Copy main.mix and redalert.mix off either CD into conf/RedAlert/mix/. To use
both sides, rename the files and change files.ini...

Red Alert 1 (Aftermath)
-----------------------
You need to install the game and copy expand2.mix, hires1.mix, lores1.mix,
main.mix and redalert.mix to conf/RedAlertAM/mix/. Then change the entry
RedAlert to RedAlertAM in general.ini.

Red Alert 1 (Demo)
------------------
There's only one zip to get:
ftp.westwood.com/pub/redalert/previews/demo/ra95demo.zip

You only need to extract these files:
- ra95demo/INSTALL/REDALERT.MIX
- ra95demo/INSTALL/MAIN.MIX

Copy them into conf/RedAlertDemo/mix/. Then change the entry RedAlert
to RedAlertDemo in general.ini.

Tiberian Dawn (Demo)
--------------------
If you do not own any of the games that the FreeCNC game engine
supports, you can download the Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn demo
and configure FreeCNC to use it.

1) Download the demo files from Westwood Studios's ftp site:
   ftp://ftp.westwood.com/pub/cc1/previews/demo/cc1demo1.zip
   ftp://ftp.westwood.com/pub/cc1/previews/demo/cc1demo2.zip
   The first is needed, but the second only contains video and music.

2) Unzip the files into the same directory as each other.
Move the mix files to TiberianDawnDemo/mix/.

NOTE: under Linux, use unzip -L to unzip the files, in order
to unzip them using lowercase file names.

3) Compile FreeCNC normally

4) Run FreeCNC as normal.

See the README file for more notes on using the demo version.
