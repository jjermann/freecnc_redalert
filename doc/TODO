List of features being worked on/designed currently
***************************************************
- Fixing assumptions that held when TD was the only game supported (e.g.
  player in campaign is either "GoodGuy", "BadGuy" or "Special",
  unit/structure colourings, etc.)

- Rearranging the layout of config files so each game gets its own
  directory making importing mods a lot easier.

- Fixing up the rough edges of the sidebar code (placement of a lot of
  things are inaccurate, fairly broken in RA, minimap isn't interactive),
  as well as incorporating various patches sent in to add things like build
  queueing (this also leads towards more functionality in the scripting
  interface).

Other stuff
***********
General
=======
- Add support for more file types (e.g. Ogg, png, mp3, etc.)

Gameplay
========
- Make some walls and infantry squashable

- More resource management: from tiberium growth to disabling powerred
  structures when a blackout occurs.

- A few features from the more recent games from the C&C series: right click
  dragging to scroll (DONE), and the autofill method of building walls.

- Passenger/loading code

- Structure bibs (small patches of rough ground that goes underneath the
  building and can not be built on).  This also fixes the UI glitch of not
  appearing to be able to place some types of buildings right at the top (this
  is because the top row of tiles isn't blocked so doesn't appear in the
  placement mat).

- Finishing Red Alert support.  (Map loading more or less done, mostly
  related to getting the new config system done to make switching between
  the two games more simple).

UI
==
- A gui toolkit for the menus etc.

- Rewriting the unit and structure animation code.  This leads to several
  things, such as support for aircraft and boats, as well as making the game
  even more customisable.  Other features that are easier to do as a
  consequence of this streamlining are proper firing, dying, etc. animations
  for infantry.

- Improve the minimap to show contacts (in progress) and make it interactive.

- Build clocks as similar to the ones in Red Alert 2 and Generals (counts down
  to when a superweapon will be ready).

Network
=======
- A protocol proxy for being able to debug a network server without breaking the
  game: players connect to the proxy which forwards between them and the server
  and will (ideally) be able to cope with anything upto the server being
  restarted.

AI
==
- Improving the AI (including base building/management).  The AI will probably
  be made pluginable and tie into the scriping engine.

- Scripting (including support for map triggers).  zx64 has had his eye on lua
  for a while.
