Hierarchy
=========

- All game specific stuff should be moved into the specific game dir in conf/.
- I would keep the game type option (in internal.ini) as there really is a
  fundamental difference between TD and RA sometimes. Maybe type 3 can be
  added for RA2. ;)


conf/
    RedAlert/
        mix/ (all RedAlert mix files)
        setup.ini (from freecnc.ini, files.ini, songs.ini)
            - command line default game specific options (map..)
            - files to load
            - playlist (default from songs.ini)
            [ - overrides freecnc.ini options (e.g. one might want to change
                the resolution specificly for RedAlert, donno) ]
	internal.ini (not to be changed by user):
            - game type specification
            - buildable_radius?
            - explosion sound/image, nothing if unspecified
	cursors.ini
        art.ini (move to structure.ini?)
        structure.ini
        talkback.ini
        templates.ini
        unit.ini
        weapons.ini
        wsa.ini
    RedAlertDemo/
        similar...
    TiberianDawn/
        similar...
    TiberianDawnGold/
        similar...
    TiberianDawnDemo/
        similar...
    freecnc.ini (from freecnc.ini):
        - game to play (tries the specified dirs)
	- command line default options (width/res/intro)


Loading (donno?)
=======

1. Find game dir
----------------
CLI_LOAD:   check command line option for game
              if found => MIX_CHECK for specified game dir
              if true => set game dir

INI_LOAD:   check freecnc.ini for game names
              if found => MIX_CHECK for each game dir
              if true => set game dir

MIX_CHECK:  check existence of files specified in setup.ini


2. Load options
---------------
parse freecnc.ini, setup.ini, command line


3. Load Mixes, start game
-------------------------
