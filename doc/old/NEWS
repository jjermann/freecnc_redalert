Next release:
0.2.1 (2003-??-??)
* Vastly improved INI file and talkback parsing.
* Portability fixes for platforms unable to be tested before the
  release of 0.2.0.
* New scaling code that can render VQAs as large as possible, as
  well as rendering in them using either interlacing, standard pixel
  copying (like the previous scaler) or linear interpolation (requires
  very high end processor).
* New scrolling code: scrolling is much smoother.  Dragging the mouse
  while holding down the right mouse button will scroll the map.
  Mouse wheel scrolls the sidebar.
* Fog of war has smoother edges.
* Easier to click on moving enemy infantry.
* Compile fixes for the tools and when using optimisations.
* Minimap now has some radar capabilities.
* Some internal code cleanup.

* Fog of war.
* Game messages are logged.
* Loading screen.
* More building rules: prerequisite and proximity checks.

0.2.0-tp2 (2002-02-14)
* Flame thrower and chemical thrower units can fire.
* Walls can be attacked.
* AI (in early stages of development).
* Health bars work (and change colour).
* Units and structures have armour (affects the effectiveness of
  weapons).
* Units and structures can now force attack (replaces control-clicking
  to apply 25 points of damage).

  message appears at the top (amongst the other messages).

0.2.0-tp1 (2001-10-05)
 * You can attack with most units and structures (that you should be
   able to).  Currently:
 Rifle infantry, Rocket infantry, Commando (no C4 effect yet), Light,
 Medium, Mammoth and Stealth tanks, NOD Buggy, Humvee, NOD Bike, APC,
 Normal and Advanced Guard towers and NOD Turrets.

 * Better VQA decoding.

 * New file-handling code.  This can handle external files
   transparently. (see below)

 * External song lists.  See songs.ini for more information.  Because
   the file handling code can transparently load external files, you
   can use the music from "Tiberian Sun" or either "Red Alert" as long
   as you've extracted the AUDs into somewhere that is searched by
   freecnc

 * Minimap

 * -nosound command line option to disable sound
