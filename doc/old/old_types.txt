Unit and Structure related types in a unit's life
=================================================


BUILDING queues (What can I build simultaneous?):
  - strqueue
  - infqueue
  - tnkqueue
  - shpqueue
  - airqueue
  - sprqueue (no money, no stop, etc...)

PRODUCTION buildings (where do built units come out? Maybe this could
        be use as return value (0,1,2) for "createmode" <- I would rename that...):
  - structure (0)
      - allied struct (allied FACT)
      - soviet struct (soviet FACT)
  - unit (1)
      - dogs (KENN)
      - allied infantry (TENT)
      - soviet infantry (BARR)
      - tanks (WEAP)
      - ships (SYRD)
      - subs (SPEN)
      - planes (AFLD)
      - helis (HPAD)
  - superweapon (2: special)

UNITTYPE (How do I handle those units internaly? Like starting, landing,
        turn anims, chronoshift, etc...):
  - infantry
  - tanks
  - ships
  - subs (they behave different than ships, e.g. come out of watter)
  - planes
  - helis

TERRAIN types (What sort of land is this?)
  - clear
  - water
  - road
  - rock
  - tree (?)
  - river
  - rough
  - wall (?)
  - beach
  - ore (?)

MOVEMENT (wheel) types (How do the different units move on a certain land
        type? Can they crush infantry (unittype)? Can they go over water?
        Can they pass rough terrain? affects default movement cost...):
  - none (default for structure)
  - none_water (for spen, syrd?)
  - foot (default for infantry)
  - track
  - wheel (default for tanks?)
  - float (default for sea)
  - hoover?

MOVEMENT cost (Where should I walk through? There are two parts: First the
        property of a certain type to move on terrain xy and a more AI
        depending setting (not unit/terrain property). But to simplify stuff
        they can maybe be combined together without further problems.
        Defaults (actually almost only the defaults should exist depend on
        terrain type and movement types...):
  - default for clear terrain for each movement type
  - ...
  - default for ore terrain for each movement type
