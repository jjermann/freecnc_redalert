Installation
============
    * See INSTALL file for installation details

Running
=======
    * Type './freecnc' to run FreeCNC
    * Type './freecnc --help' to see the various command line arguments.

    * You also can use the FreeCNC Launcher Tools of your platform.
      Switch to the /tools/Launcher/ directory and choose your platform. Follow
      the instructions in the README of that directory.

Selecting other maps
====================
The naming scheme used by Westwood for their single player maps is
roughly:

SC[GB][0-9][0-9][WE][ABC]

Examples: SCB01EA (first NOD mission), SCG15EB (one of the final GDI
missions), SCB13EC (one of the final NOD missions).
Higher map numbers are used for the Covert Operations missions.

Mulitplayer maps have 'M' instead of G or B.

Red Alert maps are similar, but with of SCU instead of SCB for the
Soviets.

FreeCNC is able to load maps that do not conform to this naming scheme
(useful for organising collections of custom maps).

Controls
========
Click your units with the mouse and click somewhere else on the map to
move them.  Right click to unselect all units, and you can also left
click and drag to select groups of units.  Shift (left) clicking units
will add them to your selection, as will holding down shift while
dragging a box around more units.  Shift clicking units that are
already selected to unselect them.

Map locations can be bookmarked: hold down control and press a
function key between F1 and F5 (inclusive) to store a location, then
press that function key to return to that location in the map.  Each
bookmark defaults to the top left corner of the map.

Selections can also be stored: hold down control and press any number
key to store your current selection in that slot.  Press that number
again later to retrieve that selection.  There is no restriction on
units or structures being exclusively in at most one stored selection.

Other controls in FreeCNC v0.2.1-CVS:

* 'v' reveals the whole map.
* 'c' lets you build on any clear terrain, regardless of proximity.
* 'b' makes all units and structures available to be built.  This is
  used primarily for debugging.
* Holding down the right mouse button and dragging will also scroll
  the map.  The further you move the mouse, the faster the scroll.
* The mouse wheel can be used to scroll the sidebar (as well as page
  up and page down).

New features from previous release (0.2.0)
==========================================
* Much improved INIFile and talkback parser: startup times are
  dramatically reduced.
* New VQA decoding code that can scale to higher resolutions.
* New scrolling code.  The map scrolls very smoothly now, and the
  right mouse button can be used to scroll the map.
* The fog of war now has smooth edges.
* If a sidebar icon can not be found, the type name is drawn instaead.
* Targetting enemy infantry with the mouse should now be easier (picks
  nearest soldier if mouse isn't on one)
* Slightly more visible Red Alert support (see below).

These features are incomplete:
* Fog of war.
* New plugin based VFS (virtual file system).
* Framework for multiplayer.

See the TODO file for a list of new features being worked on.

INI File Overview
=================
FreeCNC comes with several ini files which allow you to extensively
customise it.  All can be found in the "conf" subdirectory.

    * freecnc.ini
        - General configuration file allowing you to set default
          command line parameters

    * files.ini
        - Defines where to look for mixfiles
        - Defines which games use what playlists

    * structure.ini
        - Defines structure-related values, such as max health etc.

    * unit.ini
        - Controls unit variables such type, speed, etc.

    * weapons.ini
        - Defines the weapon types, the warheads and the explosion
        animations.

    * songs.ini
        - Defines the various playlists.  At the end of songs.ini, there
    is a playlist called EG.  To use it, change the relevant "playN=TD"
    line in files.ini to "playN=EG".  This playlist uses tracks that
    only exist in the English DOS version, although may exist in other
    editions of the DOS version.

    * talkback.ini
        - Talkback information is stored here.

The following ini files shouldn't normally need to be edited:
    * art.ini
        - Allows you to modify the size and placement of structures
          on tiles. Refer to that file for details

    * templates.ini
        - Contains values for all map tiles. See templates.ini
          for details

    * wsa.ini
        - Not much at the moment.  Will contain information related to
        the animations (e.g. select side, mission and target at end of
        NOD campaign).

Demo versions
=============
The maps available in the Tiberian Dawn demo are:

SCG01EA, SCG03EA, SCG05EA, SCG06EA, SCG07EA and SCG10EA
(No NOD missions)

The Red Alert demo has
SCG02EA SCG05EA and SCU01EA (which is oddly named as it's actually the second
Soviet mission)

Known bugs
==========
* VQAs play as fast as possible if sound is disabled.

* The values for weapon ranges, how much damage they do, etc. need
  adjusting.  Please send in your ideas on how to improve them.

* Some maps rely on triggers to supply the human player with units, so
  you will get a free MCV.  The map will be revealed and you will be
  able to place the MCV on any clear cell (proximity checks are then
  re-enabled).

* The DLL code hasn't been tested on many platforms: known to work on
  Linux, OpenBSD, Win32 with MSVC, and MacOSX.

* Compilation on some operating systems with certain versions of gcc may
  require disabling the -ansi -pedantic CFLAGS in the Makefiles.

* Some maps in the original game have bugs in them, such as units and
  structures placed on the same cell and more importantly not all
  GDI/Civilian alliances are explicitly stated in all maps.  The
  existing win detection code requires you to destroy /all/ enemies,
  which will include civilians on these maps (even as GDI).  We'll fix
  this in later releases by patching the maps.

* Although this is an SDL issue, it's worth mentioning here:
  If FreeCNC crashes when fullscreen, the mouse may be locked and you
  may not be able to change the resolution back.  To fix this, rerun
  FreeCNC in fullscreen then exit cleanly (you may have to change your
  resolution back manually afterwards).

"Eye-candy" bugs:
* Muzzle flash animations aren't properly centred.
* Construction Yard appears to build something when damaged to 50%
  health.
* MCV doesn't turn when deploying.
* Buildings that start off with a rotation don't crumble when damaged to 50%+
